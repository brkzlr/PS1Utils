# EDCChecker
This is a small program that checks PS1 CD bin files for small corruptions like the sync headers and EDC mismatch.

Wrote it while analyzing EDC anti-piracy checks. I doubt it's going to be useful for anything but at least it contains some nice info about the general layout of the CD-ROM XA format.
